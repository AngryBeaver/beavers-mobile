- you can add a virtual gamepad to control a token (you need a gamepad module e.g. [beavers-gamepad](https://github.com/AngryBeaver/beavers-gamepad))
  - you need to configure the virtual gamepad as usually (it is registered as if it is a real gamepad)
- uses [beavers-token-movement](https://github.com/AngryBeaver/beavers-system-interface/wiki/Beaver's-System-Interface#tokenmovementcreate-v214) to move the token around
- disable canvas now also hides unwanted canvas control items as well as if existent the dice so nice box which provides on most mobiles a black box overlapping everything.
